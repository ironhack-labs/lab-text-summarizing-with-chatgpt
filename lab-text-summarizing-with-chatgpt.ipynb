    "Step 2: One Page Report Summarizing the Findings\n",
    "1. Overview of Prompt Experiments:\n",
    "In this exercise, we experimented with different versions of summarizing prompts for product reviews on an ecommerce site. The prompts focused on different aspects such as product quality, customer service, and pricing information. The goal was to generate summaries that are specific, concise, and relevant to the given focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Observations:\n",
    "Version 1 (Product Quality Focus): The model was able to accurately summarize the product quality, capturing key elements such as durability, functionality, and any issues mentioned by the reviewer. However, some nuances (e.g., “motor making a funny noise after a year” in the blender review) were sometimes missing from the summary.\n",
    "Version 2 (Customer Service Focus): This version worked particularly well when the review included interactions with customer support, such as the standing lamp review where the company replaced a broken part. However, when reviews lacked direct customer service mentions (e.g., the panda plush review), the summary sometimes invented unnecessary details about the service, which can be considered a hallucination.\n",
    "Version 3 (Pricing Focus): The model was able to consistently capture pricing information from the reviews, often highlighting specific price points and value considerations. This version worked best when the reviewer explicitly discussed prices, sales, or deals. In reviews where pricing was less central (e.g., the toothbrush review), the summary was somewhat vague.\n",
    "3. Challenges and Limitations:\n",
    "Hallucinations: When the reviews lacked details on the specific aspect we were focusing on (e.g., no customer service interaction in a review), the model sometimes fabricated details to fit the prompt. This was evident in Version 2 when reviews without customer service feedback still returned summaries about customer service.\n",
    "Nuanced Language: When dealing with more nuanced or mixed reviews (e.g., a product is great but has a minor flaw), the model struggled to capture that balance. It tended to lean towards either the positive or negative side without reflecting the nuance.\n",
    "4. What I Learned:\n",
    "Prompt Specificity: The more specific the prompt, the better the output. Using the keyword “extract” instead of “summarize” when looking for specific information (like customer service or pricing) significantly improved the model’s response, as it did not try to interpret or infer irrelevant details.\n",
    "Model's Dependency on Context: The model performed well when the context in the review matched the requested focus (e.g., customer service or price). However, when a review lacked relevant information, the model sometimes introduced irrelevant content, making it important to handle outputs carefully and validate them.\n",
    "Conciseness vs. Detail: Setting strict word or character limits forced the model to omit certain details, which is useful for generating highly concise summaries but can lead to loss of important information. Depending on the use case, one might need to adjust the prompt to allow more space for details.\n",
    "5. Conclusion:\n",
    "Overall, this exercise demonstrated the effectiveness of large language models like GPT-3.5 in generating targeted summaries. However, careful prompt engineering is required to ensure accurate and useful outputs. Hallucinations are a potential issue when the requested focus isn't directly addressed in the source text, but this can be mitigated by using specific prompts that aim to extract rather than summarize.\n",
