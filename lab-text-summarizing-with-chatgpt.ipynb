      "The reviewer purchased a panda plush toy for their daughter's birthday and mentioned that she loves it and takes it everywhere. They found the toy to be soft, cute, and with a friendly face. However, they felt it was a bit small for the price paid and suggested there might be larger options available for the same price. The reviewer also noted that the toy arrived a day earlier than expected, allowing them to play with it before giving it to their daughter. \n",

Despite issues with the lamp's string and a missing part, the company provided quick and efficient customer support, showcasing their dedication to customer satisfaction. Overall, the reviewer found the company to be caring and the product to be of good quality. \n",

      "2 The reviewer highly values the electric toothbrush's impressive battery life and overall performance. However, they express disappointment in the small toothbrush head size, wishing for larger and more effective bristles. Despite this, they recommend the product for its effectiveness and affordability, especially when purchased at around $50. The reviewer also mentions the availability of cheaper generic replacement heads as a cost-saving option. Overall, the toothbrush leaves their teeth feeling exceptionally clean, akin to a professional dental cleaning. \n",
      "\n",
      "3 The reviewer noted a significant price increase in the product after a seasonal sale, with the base of the system not looking as good as previous editions. They shared tips on using the blender and mentioned the motor making a funny noise after a year, leading to the need to purchase another one due to expired warranty. The overall quality of the product was perceived to have decreased over time. \n",
