The user mentions concerns about the quality of the base where the blade locks into place and mentions using the system for blending and pulverizing various items.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Price-to-value ratio:\n",
      "Review 1 mentions that if the electric toothbrush can be found around the $50 mark, it's a good deal. They also note that the manufacturer's replacement heads are expensive, but generic ones are more reasonably priced. Review 2 talks about the system being on sale for $49 but later increasing in price to $70-$89. The user also mentions that the overall quality of the product has decreased over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Durability and quality concerns:\n",
      "Review 1 does not mention any durability or quality concerns with the electric toothbrush. Review 2, however, mentions that after about a year, the motor of the system started making a funny noise, and the user had to buy another one as the warranty had expired. The user also notes that the overall quality of the product has decreased over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Usage experience:\n",
      "Review 1 mentions that the electric toothbrush makes their teeth feel sparkly clean and gives them a dentist-like feeling every day. Review 2 talks about using the system for various blending and pulverizing tasks and provides tips for making smoothies. The user also mentions that they had to buy another system after the motor started making a funny noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Review 1 seems to be more positive about the product they reviewed, with the main concern being the size of the toothbrush head. Review 2, on the other hand, has more concerns about the price increase, quality decrease, and durability issues with the product they reviewed.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Analysis of Different Summarization Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Customer Sentiment Analysis (First Test):\n",
    "   - Effectively captured emotional responses\n",
    "   - Provided clear satisfaction ratings\n",
    "   - Helped understand customer experience\n",
    "   - No hallucinations observed\n",
    "   - Very reliable for understanding customer feelings\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pros/Cons Analysis (Second Test):\n",
    "   - Structured format made information easy to digest\n",
    "   - Sometimes struggled to find 3 cons when product was good\n",
    "   - Verdict section provided good overall context\n",
    "   - Occasionally repeated information\n",
    "   - Most practical for quick decision making\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Technical Comparative Analysis (Third Test):\n",
    "   - Good at identifying specific features\n",
    "   - Successfully compared similar products\n",
    "   - Helped understand value propositions\n",
    "   - Sometimes included too much detail\n",
    "   - Best for in-depth product understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Learnings:\n",
    "1. Different prompt structures yield very different types of insights\n",
    "2. More specific prompts (like pros/cons) give more structured responses\n",
    "3. Temperature setting of 0.25 provided good balance of creativity and consistency\n",
    "4. Extraction-based prompts were more precise than general summarization\n",
    "5. Comparative analysis works better with related products than unrelated ones"
