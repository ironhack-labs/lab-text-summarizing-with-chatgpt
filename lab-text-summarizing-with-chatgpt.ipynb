Initially, I experimented with the exercise provided, summarizing e-commerce product descriptions from an online store. Then, I tried the same with Amazon product listings and finally with reviews for the hotel where we’ll stay during our vacation in Budapest. Across all these cases, the summaries were incredibly coherent and fit perfectly for the task.\n",

    "To explore further, I experimented with the extract prompt instead of summarize. For this, I requested summaries tailored to the UX design department at Booking.com. Interestingly, the output felt almost identical to the other summaries until I adjusted the prompt. I instructed the model to provide advice for UX design in sentence form, and the results were astonishing. The chatbot delivered concise, actionable tips for UX design, proving how versatile and powerful the summarization capabilities are when properly guided by a prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise demonstrated that while different summary types (e.g., extract, summarize) may appear similar at first glance, their real power lies in how you define the prompt. Providing additional context or specific instructions, like asking for UX tips, can significantly influence the depth and utility of the output. The results were consistently impressive, showcasing ChatGPT's adaptability to different summarization needs."
