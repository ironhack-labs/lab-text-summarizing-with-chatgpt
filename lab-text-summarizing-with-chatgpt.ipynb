Moedas will join the board of trustees of the Gulbenkian Foundation as an executive member. The Portuguese institution promotes the arts, philanthropy, science and education.\n",

Yet, as mentioned… the Foundation and Commissioner Moedas have agreed that his precise assignment would not directly concern the Institute of Science or investment responsibilities.”\n",

The position has been vacant since its last occupant, Martin Selmayr, left in July after just 17 months as head of the EU’s civil service.\n",
    "I needn’t rehash the details of Selmayr’s appointment, which caused quite a kerfuffle that continues to have ripple effects throughout Brussels. In order to avoid that kind of drama, the von der Leyen Commission has taken a page from the European Ombudsman’s playbook, it seems, which had suggested a specific appointment procedure for the position.\n",
    "Step 1: Make this a separate hiring process from other positions. Step 2: Publish a vacancy notice. Step 3: Tell people how long they have to apply for the gig. Step 4: Avoid becoming the “monster of the Berlaymont.” Just kidding, step 4 was my addition. But solid advice nonetheless.\n",
