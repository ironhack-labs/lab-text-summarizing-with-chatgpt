    "Prompt Analysis Report\n",
    "Objective\n",
    "In this exercise, I experimented with different prompt versions to generate concise summaries of product reviews using GPT. I tried three versions, each focusing on different aspects of the reviews such as conciseness, price, and shipping information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Version 1 (Concise summaries): The model was able to generate very short summaries, but in some cases, it omitted important details or over-simplified the content. For instance, one summary left out the issue with the lamp’s broken string and instead only mentioned the shipping time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strength: Good at keeping the summary short.\n",
    "Weakness: Occasionally oversimplified and missed important context.\n",
    "Version 2 (Focus on price and value): This prompt worked well in extracting the price-related content, but in some cases, the model inferred information that was not explicitly mentioned in the review. For example, it interpreted that the price was \"reasonable\" even though the review did not state this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strength: Focused extraction of price information worked effectively.\n",
    "Weakness: Some hallucinations occurred, where GPT inferred or added details not present in the review.\n",
    "Version 3 (Focus on price, value, and shipping): The model gave balanced summaries including both price and shipping information. However, in one case, it focused too much on shipping and neglected the price details, which were critical to the review.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strength: It was generally effective at pulling multiple pieces of relevant information.\n",
    "Weakness: In some cases, the balance between the two focus points (price and shipping) was uneven.\n",
    "Variations that didn’t work well\n",
    "Version 2 was problematic in cases where the model inferred details about price or value that weren’t explicitly mentioned. For instance, GPT hallucinated that the blender was “expensive,” even though the review simply mentioned a price increase. This misinterpretation showed that the model may fill gaps in a way that can lead to incorrect outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lessons Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to be specific about what you want to extract from the review. If the prompt is vague, GPT may hallucinate or omit important information.\n",
    "When extracting multiple pieces of information (e.g., price and delivery), ensuring the model doesn’t prioritize one over the other is key.\n",
    "Short prompts work well for very general summaries, but for more specific details, they may not capture the nuance of the review.\n",
    "3. What did you learn?\n",
    "Prompt specificity is crucial. The more specific the prompt, the less likely the model is to hallucinate or skip key information.\n",
    "Concise prompts work for general summaries but may oversimplify details.\n",
    "Extraction-focused prompts help zero in on specific information, but there’s a risk of the model generating inferred details that aren’t present in the text."
